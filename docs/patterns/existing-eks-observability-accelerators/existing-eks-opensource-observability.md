# Existing EKS Cluster Open Source Observability Accelerator

## Architecture

The following figure illustrates the architecture of the pattern we will be deploying for Existing EKS Cluster Open Source Observability pattern, using AWS native tools such as CloudWatch, AWS Managed Prometheus(AMP), AWS Managed Grafana(AMG), and X-Ray and Open Source tools such as Amazon Distro for OpenTelmetry (ADOT) and Prometheus Node Exporter.

![Architecture](../images/CDK_Architecture_diagram.png)

Monitoring Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for metrics has two categories: the control plane and the Amazon EKS nodes (with Kubernetes objects). The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane nodes that run the Kubernetes software, such as etcd and the Kubernetes API server. To read more on the components of an Amazon EKS cluster,
please read the [service documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/clusters.html).

## Objective

Configure the existing Amazon EKS cluster with below Observability components;
- AWS Distro For OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector for Metrics and Traces
- Logs with [AWS for FluentBit](https://github.com/aws/aws-for-fluent-bit)
- Installs Grafana Operator to add AWS data sources and create Grafana Dashboards to Amazon Managed Grafana.
- Installs FluxCD to perform GitOps sync of a Git Repo to EKS Cluster. We will use this later for creating Grafana Dashboards and AWS datasources to Amazon Managed Grafana. You can also use your own GitRepo  to sync your own Grafana resources such as Dashboards, Datasources etc. Please check our One observability module - [GitOps with Amazon Managed Grafana](https://catalog.workshops.aws/observability/en-US/aws-managed-oss/gitops-with-amg) to learn more about this.
- Installs External Secrets Operator to retrieve and Sync the Grafana API keys.
- Amazon Managed Grafana Dashboard and data source
- Alerts and recording rules with AWS Managed Service for Prometheus

## Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have installed the following tools on your machine:

1. [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
2. [kubectl](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
3. [cdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install)
4. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install)

You will also need:

1. Either an existing EKS cluster, or you can setup a new one with  [Single New EKS Cluster Observability Accelerator](../single-new-eks-observability-accelerators/single-new-eks-cluster.md)
2. An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, associated to the above EKS cluster (Note: Single EKS Cluster Pattern takes care of that for you)

## Deploying

1. Edit `~/.cdk.json` by setting the name of your existing cluster:

```json
    "context": {
        ...
        "existing.cluster.name": "...",
        ...
    }
```

2. Edit `~/.cdk.json` by setting the kubectl role name; if you used Single New EKS Cluster Observability Accelerator to setup your cluster, the kubectl role name would be provided by the output of the deployment, on your command-line interface (CLI):

```json
    "context": {
        ...
        "existing.kubectl.rolename":"...",
        ...
    }
```

3. Amazon Managed Grafana workspace: To visualize metrics collected, you need an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace. If you have an existing workspace, create an environment variable as described below. To create a new workspace, visit [our supporting example for Grafana](https://aws-observability.github.io/terraform-aws-observability-accelerator/helpers/managed-grafana/)

!!! note
For the URL `https://g-xyz.grafana-workspace.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`, the workspace ID would be `g-xyz`

```bash
export AWS_REGION=<YOUR AWS REGION>
export COA_AMG_WORKSPACE_ID=g-xxx
export COA_AMG_ENDPOINT_URL=https://g-xyz.grafana-workspace.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

!!! warning
Setting up environment variables `COA_AMG_ENDPOINT_URL` and `AWS_REGION` is mandatory for successful execution of this pattern.

4. GRAFANA API KEY: Amazon Managed Grafana provides a control plane API for generating Grafana API keys.

```bash
export AMG_API_KEY=$(aws grafana create-workspace-api-key \
  --key-name "grafana-operator-key" \
  --key-role "ADMIN" \
  --seconds-to-live 432000 \
  --workspace-id $COA_AMG_WORKSPACE_ID \
  --query key \
  --output text)
```

5. AWS SSM Parameter Store for GRAFANA API KEY: Update the Grafana API key secret in AWS SSM Parameter Store using the above new Grafana API key. This will be referenced by Grafana Operator deployment of our solution to access Amazon Managed Grafana from Amazon EKS Cluster

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/cdk-accelerator/grafana-api-key" \
    --type "SecureString" \
    --value $AMG_API_KEY \
    --region $AWS_REGION
```

6. Install project dependencies by running `npm install` in the main folder of this cloned repository.

7. The actual settings for dashboard urls are expected to be specified in the CDK context. Generically it is inside the cdk.json file of the current directory or in `~/.cdk.json` in your home directory.

Example settings: Update the context in `cdk.json` file located in `cdk-eks-blueprints-patterns` directory

```
    "context": {
        "cluster.dashboard.url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-observability-accelerator/main/artifacts/grafana-dashboards/eks/infrastructure/cluster.json",
        "kubelet.dashboard.url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-observability-accelerator/main/artifacts/grafana-dashboards/eks/infrastructure/kubelet.json",
        "namespaceworkloads.dashboard.url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-observability-accelerator/main/artifacts/grafana-dashboards/eks/infrastructure/namespace-workloads.json",
        "nodeexporter.dashboard.url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-observability-accelerator/main/artifacts/grafana-dashboards/eks/infrastructure/nodeexporter-nodes.json",
        "nodes.dashboard.url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-observability-accelerator/main/artifacts/grafana-dashboards/eks/infrastructure/nodes.json",
        "workloads.dashboard.url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-observability-accelerator/main/artifacts/grafana-dashboards/eks/infrastructure/workloads.json"
      }
```

8. Once all pre-requisites are set you are ready to deploy the pipeline. Run the following command from the root of this repository to deploy the pipeline stack:

```bash
make build
make pattern existing-eks-opensource-observability deploy
```

## Verify the resources

Please see [Single New EKS Open Source Observability Accelerator](../single-new-eks-observability-accelerators/single-new-eks-opensource-observability.md).

## Teardown

You can teardown the whole CDK stack with the following command:

```bash
make pattern existing-eks-opensource-observability destroy
```

If you setup your cluster with Single New EKS Cluster Observability Accelerator, you also need to run:

```bash
make pattern single-new-eks-cluster destroy
```
